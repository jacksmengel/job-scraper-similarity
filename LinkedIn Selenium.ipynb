We started as a small team of developers determined to bring trust and transparency to car shopping. Since then, our history of innovation and go-to-market acceleration has driven industry-leading growth. In fact, we’re the largest and fastest-growing automotive marketplace, and we’ve been profitable for over 15 years.\\n\\nWhat We Do\\n\\nThe market is evolving, and we are too, moving the entire automotive journey online and guiding our customers through every step. That includes everything from the sale of an old car to the financing, purchase, and delivery of a new one. Today, tens of millions of consumers visit CarGurus.com each month, and ~30,000 dealerships use our products. But they're not the only ones who love CarGurus—our employees do, too. We have a people-first culture that fosters kindness, collaboration, and innovation, and empowers our Gurus with tools to fuel their career growth. Disrupting a trillion-dollar industry requires fresh and diverse perspectives. Come join us for the ride!\\n\\nRole Overview\\n\\nAs the Manager, Product Data Analytics you will lead a team of highly skilled product data analysts that support our Product and Engineering teams, providing the final word on all analytics for CarGurus’ user and dealer experiences.

In doing so, you will gain exposure to multiple dimensions of the business and cross-functionally influence many different roadmaps in addition to your own.\\n\\nWhat You’ll Tackle\\n\\nExploration: Using your SQL/Python expertise, lead a team of analysts to conduct exploratory empirical analyses that bridge disparate data sources (e.g. clickstream data, subscription records, inventory volumes, etc.) to quantify product performance, user behavior, and/or market trends. Relentlessly dig into the data – consulting with other individuals and teams as you judge necessary.\\nProcess: Design and build technical processes to address business issues. Oversee the data/report requests process: tracking requests submitted, prioritization, approval, etc. Manage and optimize processes for data intake, validation, mining and engineering as well as modeling, visualization and communication deliverables.\\nMetrics: Oversee the design and delivery of reports and insights that analyze business functions and key operations and performance metrics. Craft the metrics that define business success, condensing abstract or loosely-defined concepts down to concrete calculations. Audit and improve existing metrics to better inform the business’ needs.\\nAdvocacy: Advocate for specific, data-driven product innovations that help further high-level company strategy, primarily in partnership with the Product/Engineering teams. Participate in brainstorming and planning discussions across the organization to these ends. Avoid passivity in the face of flawed proposals; tactfully and persuasively push back against potential missteps.\\nExperimentation: Be a source of guidance for A/B experimentation, advising engineers, product managers, and high-level stakeholders on everything from the necessary data points to collect, required sample sizes, optimal metrics to examine, robustness of numerical findings, and the bottom-line success or failure of the tested changes. Suggest improvements to A/B testing-related tools, algorithms, and automated processes.\\nVisualizations: Build intuitive dashboards and other visual monitoring tools to guide daily decision-making by senior stakeholders and the company at large. Experiment with new kinds of visualizations that you believe could be better utilized in the organization. Re-work underlying code to appropriately structure visualization inputs.\\nArchitecture: Conceive of new data assets and build automated transformations (via DBT, LookML, etc.) to bring them to fruition. Partner with Data Engineering teams to advance core data modeling/architecture (e.g. user clickstream logs), by optimizing, integrating, and distilling large raw datasets and metadata. Draw upon prior experience with expansive, unrefined datasets to fix modeling bottlenecks in quick, scalable, outside-of-the-box ways.\\nCommunication: Communicate and present complex quantitative findings in easily digestible terms to company leadership, homing in on key takeaways. Concretely and informatively respond to any probing, on-the-spot follow-up questions from senior decision-makers.\\nTraining: Train, develop and supervise analyst-level employees. When necessary, be comfortable creating onboarding plans and training materials. Be proficient within our tech stack so that you can guide analysts towards innovative data solutions.\\n\\nWho You Are\\n\\nBachelors/Masters Degree with 5+ years of experience in an analytics or analytics-adjacent field, ideally involving complex data modeling, quantitative analysis, and applied statistics.\\n2+ years of experience leading a team.\\nA natural thought leader with a proven track record of influencing business strategy through expert stakeholder management skills.\\nExpert fluency in SQL. Strong background in Python is highly desirable.\\nWorking knowledge of data mining principles: predictive analytics, mapping, user-tracking, collecting data from multiple data systems on premises and cloud-based data sources.\\nUnderstanding of and experience using analytical concepts and statistical techniques: hypothesis development, designing tests/experiments, analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and developing actionable recommendations for business units.\\nSecond-nature understanding of core statistical concepts (regression, significance testing, omitted variable bias, independence/dependence, etc.)\\nKnack for creative data visualizations.\\nWillingness to step outside your role and independently come up with novel ideas for the business.\\nWillingness to challenge others’ ideas and advocate for your own.\\nExcellent verbal and written communication skills. Very comfortable presenting high-impact and potentially sensitive findings to senior leadership.\\nStrong project planning skills, with experience building roadmaps, estimating required resources, and flagging inter-dependencies with other teams/projects.\\nStrong ability to plan and manage numerous processes, people and projects simultaneously.\\nProficient and experienced in the following tools/programs: Looker, Snowflake, DBT, Salesforce, Jira, Snowplow, Google Suite/Microsoft Suite\\n\\nWorking at CarGurus\\n\\nWe reward our Gurus’ curiosity and passion with best-in-class benefits and compensation, including equity for all employees, both when they start and as they continue to grow with us. Our career development and corporate giving programs, as well as our employee resource groups (ERGs) and communities, help people build connections while making an impact in personally meaningful ways.

Participate in brainstorming and planning discussions across the organization to these ends. Avoid passivity in the face of flawed proposals; tactfully and persuasively push back against potential missteps.\\nExperimentation: Be a source of guidance for A/B experimentation, advising engineers, product managers, and high-level stakeholders on everything from the necessary data points to collect, required sample sizes, optimal metrics to examine, robustness of numerical findings, and the bottom-line success or failure of the tested changes. Suggest improvements to A/B testing-related tools, algorithms, and automated processes.\\nVisualizations: Build intuitive dashboards and other visual monitoring tools to guide daily decision-making by senior stakeholders and the company at large. Experiment with new kinds of visualizations that you believe could be better utilized in the organization. Re-work underlying code to appropriately structure visualization inputs.\\nArchitecture: Conceive of new data assets and build automated transformations (via DBT, LookML, etc.) to bring them to fruition. Partner with Data Engineering teams to advance core data modeling/architecture (e.g. user clickstream logs), by optimizing, integrating, and distilling large raw datasets and metadata. Draw upon prior experience with expansive, unrefined datasets to fix modeling bottlenecks in quick, scalable, outside-of-the-box ways.\\nCommunication: Communicate and present complex quantitative findings in easily digestible terms to company leadership, homing in on key takeaways. Concretely and informatively respond to any probing, on-the-spot follow-up questions from senior decision-makers.\\nTraining: Train, develop and supervise analyst-level employees. When necessary, be comfortable creating onboarding plans and training materials. Be proficient within our tech stack so that you can guide analysts towards innovative data solutions.\\n\\nWho You Are\\n\\nBachelors/Masters Degree with 5+ years of experience in an analytics or analytics-adjacent field, ideally involving complex data modeling, quantitative analysis, and applied statistics.\\n2+ years of experience leading a team.\\nA natural thought leader with a proven track record of influencing business strategy through expert stakeholder management skills.\\nExpert fluency in SQL. Strong background in Python is highly desirable.\\nWorking knowledge of data mining principles: predictive analytics, mapping, user-tracking, collecting data from multiple data systems on premises and cloud-based data sources.\\nUnderstanding of and experience using analytical concepts and statistical techniques: hypothesis development, designing tests/experiments, analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and developing actionable recommendations for business units.\\nSecond-nature understanding of core statistical concepts (regression, significance testing, omitted variable bias, independence/dependence, etc.)\\nKnack for creative data visualizations.\\nWillingness to step outside your role and independently come up with novel ideas for the business.\\nWillingness to challenge others’ ideas and advocate for your own.\\nExcellent verbal and written communication skills.
